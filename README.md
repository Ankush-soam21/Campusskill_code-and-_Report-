# Human Detection Robot 🔔🤖

This project is a simple *Arduino-based Human Detection Robot* using a *PIR sensor* to detect human presence. When motion is detected, a *buzzer* alerts the user.  

## 🚀 Features
- Detects human motion using a *PIR sensor*  
- Alerts with a *buzzer* when a human is detected  
- Low-cost and beginner-friendly project  
- Can be extended to control *motors/robot movement*  

## 🛠 Components Used
- Arduino UNO  
- PIR Sensor (Human detection sensor)  
- Buzzer  
- Battery (7–12V for Arduino UNO)  
- Jumper Wires
